## A funny story
Once I went to the university just to see a class, I noticed that people were looking at me a lot, "Today I'm looking very good üòè" I thought, my teacher never came so I returned home, when I was on the bus I saw my reflection in the window and I noticed that I had my shirt backwards... that's why they were looking at me a lot üòÑ

### TL;DR :

Check your shirt twice before leaving home.
